Mars 2020:

prologue
After the great shutdown of 2018 - 2019 the U.S government found itself incapable of building a necessary defensive structure to 
keep out the invading caravans. By April first of 2019 the U.S had been completely overtaken by the numerous invading caravans made
 of "stone cold criminals" The U.S was immediatly made into a lawless waste-land. In a measure to prevent Voter ID Fraud for the 
 2020 election the president decided that the only valid form of identification was tweet from 2016 or earlier that said "MAEK 
 AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!" but because of the oddly specific criteria you were the only one who qualified to vote.


					Mechanics
STATS- an entity has 6 different stats with an average of 10 per stat - characters start with a stat 18 or below;

Base stats
str = 10; 
dex = 10; 
con = 10; 
int = 10; 
wis = 10; 
lck = 10; 


attribute Bonus(AB) <(stat-10)/2>
*Add flat damage
*Add AC
*ADD to saves
*Hit points

@creation
HP = 8 + CB
AC = 10 + DB + items + {LB}
MR = CB + (WB * 2) + Items
Mana = WB + (IB * 2)
Attack Bonus = Level + SB
Political Bonus = Blue: (-2 STR, -2 DEX, +2 WIS, +2 INT, 200 Gold, 100 Score) | Red: (+2 STR, +2 DEX, -2 WIS, -2 INT, 100 Gold, 200 Score) | White: (+0 Stats, 9,001 Gold, 9,001 Score)
Gold = Political Bonus + (1D100 * LB)
Score = Political Bonus + (1D100 * LB)
Inventory[] = Blue: (Tool = Lunar Book, Weapon = Cell Phone, Armor = Space Helmet) | Red: (Tool = Solar Book, Weapon = Drill, Armor = Space Helmet) | White: (Nothing)

@level up
HP = HP + 1D8 + CB
AC = 10 + DB + Items + [LB]
MR = MR + CB + (WB * 2) + Items
Mana = Mana + WB + (IB * 2)
Attack Bonus = Attack Bonus + Level + SB
Political Bonus = (Decisions in the future may affect these numbers)
Gold = N/A
Score = N/A
Inventory[] = N/A

(HP formula) = base health + armor + AB
(MP formula) = intelligence + (luck * 2) + class mana bonus
(AC formula) = HP + class health bonus
level up = stats * LUCKBONUS

Attribute Bonus
str = 11; SB = 0;
dex = 17; DB = 3;

int = 18; IB = 4;
wis = 18; WB = 4;
lck = 13; LB = 1;
