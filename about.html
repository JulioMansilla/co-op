                <p class="bio">Ryan Howard, as the newest hire in the Scranton branch was initially extremely confused as to how the office worked and often acts as the straight man in his role as the temp. He is often mild mannered and meek in comparison to the louder personalities in the Office. Similar to Jim, Ryan has a poor outlook on Michael's management style and doesn't intend to work at Dunder Mifflin long term. Despite this, he's shown to be quite ambitious.</p>
